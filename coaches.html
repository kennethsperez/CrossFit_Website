  <h3>Zach Gordon</h3>
  <p>Zach is the owner of Ballast CrossFit and his journey towards this adventure started with stumbling across CrossFit while he was stationed in Japan. Before that time, his fitness included weightlifting, running, and swimming but CrossFit caused his outlook on fitness to evolve. He began to change the way he viewed what it meant to be fit. It was no longer about appearance as much as it was about performance. After spending two years in Japan, Zach came back to the states and got his Level 1 CrossFit certification. He also went on to get his CrossFit Weightlifting and CrossFit Powerlifting Certifications. After transitioning out of the military and starting college, Zach began coaching on a daily basis. "I genuinely love working out and helping others reach their fitness goals. That passion makes coming to work enjoyable." Zach is not only a firm believer in physical fitness but mental toughness as well. His ability to work well with others and his communication skills make people feel comfortable and the members at his gym love him.

<h3>Joan Balagasay</h3>

<p>For as long as Joan can remember, she was always active and competing with her peers. This competitive drive compelled her to excel at everything she tried. From playing basketball in high school to recreational sports as an adult, she always had a love for physical fitness. In 2013, Joan was introduced to CrossFit and instantly fell in love with the methodology, community, and intensity of the sport. After being a regular gym-goer for some time, her first CrossFit experience was extremely humbling. This challenge helped Joan realize she could continue to push herself past her limits and strive for more. Each time she conquered a weakness, she fell more in love with CrossFit and its ability to show her just how much she could achieve. Joan realized she wanted to pass this on to others through coaching. Her goal as a coach is to help athletes reach their fitness goals in a fun and safe manner, By teaching others to trust the process, practice proper mechanics and technique, and maintain consistency through intensity, Joan can show athletes how quickly results will follow.
